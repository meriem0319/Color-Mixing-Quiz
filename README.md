# Color-Mixing-Quiz Application

## My Task

This Challenge is asking me to build a timed quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## User Story

```
As an artist who loves to paint 
I want to take a timed quiz about mixing paint colors
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN I am alerted that the time is up
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials AND be shown my score
```
